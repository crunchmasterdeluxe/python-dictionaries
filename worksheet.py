# define a dictionary
d = get_dictionary()

# 1. Without looping, print the dictionary's items (key-value pairs)


# 2. Without looping, print the dictionary's keys


# 3. Without looping, print the dictionary's values


# 4. Add a new item to the dictionary


# 5. Loop through the dictionary and print out the keys


# 6. As you loop through the dictionary, print the key and its value


# 7. Print the length of the dictionary (how many items does it contain?)
